    <h1> A Little About Myself</h1>
        <p> Hello! my name is Jeff. I am an automotive technician (hopefully not for long) and I was a DOTA addict up until 10 months ago. That is when my first child was born. She is my everything and actually the reason I am taking this class. I want to be able to provide a better life for her as well as the rest of my family. I am hoping to put a lot of work in and gain the skill set I need to exceed the industry standards.</p>
