        <p> Hello! my name is Jeff. I am an automotive technician (hopefully not for long) and I was a DOTA addict up until 10 months ago. That is when my first child was born. She is my everything and actually the reason I am taking this class. I want to be able to provide a better life for her as well as the rest of my family. I am hoping to put a lot of work in and gain the skill set I need to meet or exceed the industry standards.</p>
        <br>
        <p> My daughter's name is Maevis. She is now 10 months old and screams louder than any baby I've ever heard. </p>
        <br>
        <p>My birthday is December 8th. I'm 27 and like to eat A LOT</p>
        <br>
        <p>I own a Subaru. It's red. It's slow. I get passed up by toyota prius' in it</p>
